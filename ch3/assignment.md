# CSC 151: Chapter 2 Assignment

If submitting code, please put each question in its own class. Make sure your input and output make sense to the user.



1. Sorting Words: Write a program that reads three words from the user. Return the list of words in alphabetical order.

```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ljkassler/ch3/Ch3A1.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch3A1 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Add your code here...
    }
}
```

To test running your code, type `java Ch3A1.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```


2. Conversions: Write a unit conversion program that askes the user the amount they would like to change, the unit they want to convert from (fl oz, gal, oz, lb, in, ft, mi), and the unit they want to convert to (ml, l, g, kg, mm, cm, m, km). Display the results. Reject any incompatible conversions, such as gal -> km.

```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ljkassler/ch3/Ch3A2.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch3A2 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Add your code here...
    }
}
```

To test running your code, type `java Ch3A2.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```
