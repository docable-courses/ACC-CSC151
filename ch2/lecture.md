This chapter we will cover variables (setting up, types, and using), comments, basic math, input/output, and basic strings.

## Variables
A variable is a storage location for a value within a computer program. When set-up and used properly, it will give the programmer a chance to recall data stored in memory. The first step in creating a variable is the variable declaration statement. This will set up a variable for usage. You must set up the type of variable being stored. You can set the variable to value immediately or later. Filling the variable with a value is called initializing.

For example:

```java
int numStudents = 15;
```

or

```java
int numStudents;
numStudents = 15;
```

### Variable Types

You can save numbers, words, or true/false into a variable. You just need to figure out what type of value you are going to save. We will cover words/Strings later in the notes. True or false values are called Booleans. They make good flags or checkers.  

For example:

```java
boolean failed = false;
boolean flag = true;
```

Numbers are probably the most commonly stored values in most computer programs. There are several different types of numbers, however, we are only going to look at two types (`int` and `double`). For the full list, go to page 40 in your textbook.

_Integers_ as known as `int`s in programming. This is a whole number without a fractional part. Even if you try saving 5.0, it will not work. You can store zero, positive, and negative numbers. However, it is only good for approximately 2.14 billion.  

For example:

```java
int numPuppies = 2;
```

The other type we will focus on is a floating point number (a number with a decimal place).  It is known as a _Double_.  The `double` can hold a range of `+/- 10^38`.

### Variable Names

After you have a variable type figured out, you need to determine a name. The name you pick should describe what is being stored. Usually variables also start with a lower case letter and follow the camel case convention. There are four big rules that must be followed. 

1. Variables must start with a letter or the underscore `_` character. The remaining name can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
2. You cannot use other symbols such as `?` or `%`.  Spaces are not allowed either.  
3. Variable names are case sensitive.  If you use all lower case, you must use lower case everywhere.  
4. You cannot use reserved words (google it or Appendix C for the list).  

### Assignment

Once you variable is declared and initialized, it can be used. What if you want to change the value of a variable? You use the assignment statement.  The equal sign `=` does not check to see if the values are equal, it is the assignment operator. It assignments a value to a variable. You are overwriting the old value with the new value. The old value is lost forever once the line is completed.  

```java
int cans = 6;  //declaration and initialization
cans = 12;   //assignment
```

### Constants
There are times we have a value that will not change once the code starts running. You can set up these variables as constants. Constants‚Äô names are set up using all capitals. The keyword final is used set these apart.

```java
final double TAX_RATE = 0.07;
```

### Comments
Comments are notes to the programmer. You can provide explanations for tricky code, variables, and program descriptions. They are very useful. The compiler ignores any text after the comment.

In Java, when you have a comment that will appear at the end of a line or only takes up one line, use the double forward slash.  The fancy word for the `//` is delimiter.

```java
//Ignore this text
```

If you have a comment that will span multiple lines you can use different delimiters. It is the `/*` (open) and `*/` (close).
```java
/* 
The equation below finds the area of a circle.
A = pi * r * r
*/
```

At the top of the document, it is common practice to use the double star at the open.  

```java
/** 
Laura Gaines
1/19/2017
This program finds the area of a triangle
*/
```

## Basic Math
Mathematic expressions is a combination of variables, literals, and operators. You must write out your math. The order of operations follows just as in regular math. Generally, you cannot use shortcuts from math. However, there are a few exceptions. First is the ++ and --. This will increase or decrease a variable by 1.

```java
counter++;
```

Second you can short cut when you are completing math for the same variable.

```java
x = x  + 5;
```

Is the same as

```java
x += 5;
```

### Integer Division and Modulus

There are two special mathematical operations in computer science, integer division and modulus. In Java, there is no special symbol to represent integer division. It will happen automatically when you divide to ints. If a single number is a floating point number, the result will have a decimal place.

Modulus (mod) returns the remainder from long division. The result will be an integer. The mod operator is the percent sign. We will work though examples in class.

### Math library
Some math operations are commonly used.  The actions (like square root) are stored into the Java library in the math class.  We can use these methods (actions) to help us solve problems.

Here are a few common methods:

| Method           | Action                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Math.sqrt(x)`   | Takes the square root of `x`                |
| `Math.pow(x, y)` | Power: `x` is the base, `y` is the exponent |
| `Math.sin(x)`    | `sin`, also the `cos`, `tan`                |
| `Math.round(x)`  | Closest integer to `x`                      |


There are two values stored in the Math class as well, Math.PI and Math.E.  You can go out and view the Java API to see more.

### Converting numbers

You can convert number to different number types. The process is called casting. The value you want to convert to goes inside parenthesis before the variable name. Casting will not round. It truncates the decimal.

```
double amount = 23.23;
int newAmount = (int)amount;
```

If you want to round, use the Math method first.

```
double amount = 23.23;
double roundAmount = Math.round(amount);
int newAmount = (int)roundAmount;
```

## Input

### Console Input

User input is not super easy in Java. üôÅ Nothing is built in. We will need to bring in pieces of the Java library to use.  

To do this, we will use the import statement.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

This line of code will go at the top of the document. I usually put it right below my comment filled with my name, date, and program explanation.  
Once, you are in the code, usually inside main, the first step is to create a scanner. This step should only happen once inside the code.

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
```

Once you scanner is created, print out a prompt or question. 

```java
System.out.println("Enter number: ");
```

You will need to know the type of variable being read in from the user.  Write the line of the code that will read in the value.

```java
int num = in.nextInt();  
```

or

```java
double aValue = in.nextDouble();
```

or 

```java
String name = in.next()
```

## Dialog Box Input

This is using built in Java classes (`JOptionPane`). All input from the box is a string and needs to be converted to a number.

Input:

```java
String input = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter price:");
double price = Double.parseDouble(input);
//int p = Interger.parseInt(input);
```

Output:

```java
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Price: " + price);
```

## Strings

Strings are any combination of characters:  letters, numbers, symbols, white space, and so on. The text is enclosed in double quotations. A string in Java is also immutable. This means the string cannot be changed. It can only be overwritten. The length of a string can be determined using the length method built into Java.

```java
String name = "The Dude";
int n = name.length();   // n will now have 8 stored 
```

If the length is zero, it means it is an empty string.

### Concatenation

Using the `+` operator, you can combine multiple strings together. This process is called concatenation. Java will not automatically put a space between characters.

```java
String fName = ‚ÄúSterling‚Äù;
String lName = ‚ÄúArcher‚Äù;
String name = fName + ‚Äú ‚Äú + lName;
```

### Escape Characters
An escape character will allow the programmer to add special touches to his/her output. For example, what if you were printing a quotation? How do you print the quotes because quotes usually stand for a string? Python has created special characters (see list below) to help you create better looking output.

| Character Escape Sequence | Name                                                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\b`                      | Backspace                                                   |
| `\t`                      | Tab                                                         |
| `\n`                      | Linefeed/Newline (like hitting enter)                       |
| `\f`                      | Formfeed (new page)                                         |
| `\r`                      | Move cursor to first position of current line (rarely used) |
| `\\`                      | Add a backslash into output                                 |
| `\'`                      | Single quote                                                |
| `\"`                      | Double                                                      |


### Substrings

As previously stated, strings are a combination of characters. Each character is given a position. Spaces are even given a position. All counting in computer science begins at zero.

```java
String n = "Harry Potter";
```

Breaks down into:

| Char     | H | a | r | r | y |   | P | o | t | t |  e |  r |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|
| Position | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |


There is a built in function, `charAt`, which allows the user to return a character at a specific location.

```java
String n = "Harry Potter";
char c1 = n.charAt(0);
char c2 = n.charAt(7);
```

The variable `c1` would have the letter `H` stored in it. The variable `c2` would have the letter `o` stored.

Substrings are a piece or a part of a whole string. When calling the method, remember it will not overwrite the original string, unless you tell it to do so. Let‚Äôs head back to Harry Potter.

```java
String n = "Harry Potter";
String first = n.substring(0, 5);
String last = n.substring(6);
```

Let‚Äôs break down the first name part. The method is named `substring`. We want the method to happen to the `String n`. So it is `n.substring()`. The first number, zero, is the starting position. The second number is one past the stopping position. The first first, should have just `"Harry"` saved.

The last name is using the same substring method, acting on the String `n`. There is only one number in the parenthesis. When this happens, the number is the starting location. The stopping location is the end of the string.

### More String Methods

Remember that Strings are immutable, which means it doesn‚Äôt change unless it is overwritten.

Example:

```java
String aString = "Bob";
System.out.println(aString.toUpperCase());   
//prints BOB on the console screen
System.out.println(aString); //prints Bob

aString = aString.toLowerCase(); 
// this overwrites it, but saving it into the save variable
System.out.println(aString); //prints bob
```

For the following Usage examples, use the following String definition.

```java
String n = ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù;
```
