# CSC 151: Chapter 2 Assignment

If submitting code, please put each question in its own class. Make sure your input and output make sense to the user.

1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers. The program will print the following results with the two integers:
    - Sum
    - Difference
    - Product
    - Average
    - Distance (absolute value of difference)
    - Max
    - Min

    > Hint: Donâ€™t forget to look at the math class for some help.

```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ACC-CSC151/ch2/Ch2A1.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch2A1 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Add your code here...
    }
}
```

To test running your code, type `java Ch2A1.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```

2. Write a program that asks the user to input:
    - A number in meters
    
    Print:
    - millimeters
    - centimeters
    - kilometers
    - yards


```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ACC-CSC151/ch2/Ch2A2.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch2A2 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Add your code here...
    }
}
```

To test running your code, type `java Ch2A2.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```

3. Write a program that has the user input their first name, middle initial, and their last name. Using the String methods, output a single string that is their first initial, middle initial, and their last name, without spaces and lower case.

Example:
```
Please enter your name:  Leslie T Hope
Output: lthope
```

```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ACC-CSC151/ch2/Ch2A3.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch2A3 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Add your code here...
    }
}
```

After writing some code, to run your code, type `java Ch2A3.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```
