# CSC 151: Chapter 4 Assignment

If submitting code, please put each question in its own class. Make sure your input and output make sense to the user. You must use loops for full credit.

1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer, `n`. The program will print the following results:

- Sum of all even numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive)
- Sum of all odd numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive)

```java | {type: 'file', path: '/ljkassler/ch3/Ch4A1.java'}
// reminder add your imports here...

public class Ch4A1 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // Write your code here...
    }
}
```

To test running your code, type `java Ch4A1.java` in the terminal window below:

``` | {type: 'terminal'}
```


2. Write a program that will generate 10 random numbers. With those numbers:

- Output the largest
- Output the smallest
- Sum of the values

Write your code here and run it to test your output ▶️

```java | {type: 'script'}
// Write your code here...

```

3. Write a program that given a word it prints the word in reverse. For example, if the user provides the input `Harry`, the program prints `yrraH`.

```java | {type: 'script'}
public class Ch4A3 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        String input = "Harry";

        // Write your code here...
    }
}
```
