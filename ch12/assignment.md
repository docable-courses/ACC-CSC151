Layout a program that simulates a vending machine. This can be done by hand on paper or on the computer. Since you do not need to program, your layout design should be thorough. Please use the CDC card idea (explained in the chapter) or something similar. This is how you would organize your thoughts ahead of time. Again, I donâ€™t want/need actual code.

Products can be purchased by inserting coins with a value at least equal to the cost of the product. A user selects a product from a list of available products, add coins, and either gets the product or gets the coins returned. The coins are returned if insufficient money was supplied or if the product is sold out. The machine will give change when too much money is added. Products can be restocked and money removed by an operator. Follow the design process that was described in this chapter. You should have multiple classes.
